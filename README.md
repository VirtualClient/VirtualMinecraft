# VirtualMinecraft

This project is a Minecraft wrapper for better version interoperability.

### A note on UniversalCraft
There is a similar project called UniversalCraft and this project even borrows some code from them.

For example: VirtualMatrixStack or the Shader-API

Most of the things available in UniversalCraft are also available here to be a more or less drop in replacement in Elementa.

In comparison to UniversalCraft, VirtualMinecraft also has an Event API for some basic Events, uses the Kyori Adventure API etc.  

UniversalCraft is licenced under the same licence as this project(state: 12.07.2022 with format dd.mm.yyyy): LGPL-3.0
